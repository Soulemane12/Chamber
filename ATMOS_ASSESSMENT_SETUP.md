# ATMOS Assessment System Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you set up the ATMOS self-assessment system that allows users to complete wellness assessments after booking sessions. The system includes:

1. **Assessment Form**: A user-friendly form with sliders for pain, stress, focus, and happiness levels
2. **Database Storage**: Secure storage of assessment data with user associations
3. **Admin Dashboard**: Comprehensive view of all assessments with analytics and export capabilities
4. **API Endpoints**: RESTful API for assessment submission and retrieval

## Database Setup

### 1. Run the SQL Script
Execute the following SQL script in your Supabase database to create the necessary tables and views:

```sql
-- Create assessments table for ATMOS self-assessment logs
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS assessments (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    booking_id UUID REFERENCES bookings(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    assessment_date DATE NOT NULL,
    assessment_time VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL, -- Format: "HH:MM AM/PM"
    first_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    pain_level INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (pain_level >= 0 AND pain_level <= 10),
    stress_level INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (stress_level >= 0 AND stress_level <= 10),
    focus_level INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (focus_level >= 0 AND focus_level <= 10),
    happiness_level INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (happiness_level >= 0 AND happiness_level <= 10),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create indexes for better query performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_assessments_user_id ON assessments(user_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_assessments_booking_id ON assessments(booking_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_assessments_date ON assessments(assessment_date);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_assessments_created_at ON assessments(created_at);

-- Create a function to automatically update the updated_at timestamp
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.updated_at = NOW();
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ language 'plpgsql';

-- Create trigger to automatically update updated_at
CREATE TRIGGER update_assessments_updated_at 
    BEFORE UPDATE ON assessments 
    FOR EACH ROW 
    EXECUTE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column();

-- Enable Row Level Security (RLS)
ALTER TABLE assessments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies for RLS
-- Users can view their own assessments
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own assessments" ON assessments
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Users can insert their own assessments
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own assessments" ON assessments
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Users can update their own assessments
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own assessments" ON assessments
    FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Admins can view all assessments (you'll need to create an admin role)
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all assessments" ON assessments
    FOR SELECT USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM user_roles 
            WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
            AND role = 'admin'
        )
    );

-- Admins can insert assessments for any user
CREATE POLICY "Admins can insert assessments" ON assessments
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM user_roles 
            WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
            AND role = 'admin'
        )
    );

-- Admins can update any assessment
CREATE POLICY "Admins can update assessments" ON assessments
    FOR UPDATE USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM user_roles 
            WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
            AND role = 'admin'
        )
    );

-- Admins can delete any assessment
CREATE POLICY "Admins can delete assessments" ON assessments
    FOR DELETE USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM user_roles 
            WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
            AND role = 'admin'
        )
    );

-- Grant necessary permissions
GRANT ALL ON assessments TO authenticated;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO authenticated;

-- Create a view for admin dashboard with user information
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW assessment_summary AS
SELECT 
    a.id,
    a.assessment_date,
    a.assessment_time,
    a.first_name,
    a.last_name,
    a.pain_level,
    a.stress_level,
    a.focus_level,
    a.happiness_level,
    a.created_at,
    u.email as user_email,
    b.date as booking_date,
    b.time as booking_time,
    b.duration as booking_duration
FROM assessments a
LEFT JOIN auth.users u ON a.user_id = u.id
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON a.booking_id = b.id
ORDER BY a.created_at DESC;

-- Grant access to the view
GRANT SELECT ON assessment_summary TO authenticated;
```

### 2. Optional: Create Admin Role Table
If you want to use the admin role system, create this additional table:

```sql
-- Create user_roles table for admin permissions
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_roles (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'user',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(user_id, role)
);

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE user_roles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own roles" ON user_roles
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Admins can manage all roles" ON user_roles
    FOR ALL USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM user_roles 
            WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
            AND role = 'admin'
        )
    );

-- Grant permissions
GRANT ALL ON user_roles TO authenticated;
```

## Customization

### Styling
The assessment form uses Tailwind CSS classes and can be customized by modifying:
- `src/components/AssessmentForm.tsx`
- `src/components/AdminAssessmentDashboard.tsx`

### Questions
To modify the assessment questions, edit the form fields in:
- `src/components/AssessmentForm.tsx`

### Database Schema
To add new fields to the assessment, modify:
- The SQL schema in `database_setup.sql`
- The form component
- The API endpoint
- The admin dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Error**
   - Verify Supabase credentials in environment variables
   - Check if the database tables exist

2. **Permission Denied**
   - Ensure RLS policies are correctly set up
   - Verify user authentication status

3. **Form Not Appearing**
   - Check that the booking completion flow is working
   - Verify the assessment form component is imported

4. **Admin Dashboard Not Loading**
   - Ensure admin authentication is working
   - Check if the assessment_summary view exists

### Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in your `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password
```
